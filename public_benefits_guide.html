            <h2>Simplified Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h2>
            <p>SNAP is a version of North Carolina’s Food and Nutrition Services program. It is a newly developed initiative that provides food assistance to elderly individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI). To be eligible for SNAP, individuals must meet the following criteria: they must be 65 years or older, reside in North Carolina, live in a one-person household, and not be living in an institution. Additionally, they must receive SSI and not be enrolled in food and nutrition services in another state.</p>

            <h2>Work First (WF)</h2>
            <p>Work First is North Carolina’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, designed to help families access resources for well-being and economic self-sufficiency. The program is based on the principle that parents are responsible for supporting themselves and their children. It provides parents with short-term training and other services to help them secure employment and achieve financial independence. Employment services are designed to meet the specific needs of each family. Additionally, relatives, grandparents, and legal guardians caring for children can access these services to prevent children from entering the foster care system. General eligibility applies to families with incomes at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Families can receive benefits for a maximum of 24 months, after which they must wait three years before reapplying for Work First cash assistance. Federal law also enforces a cumulative lifetime limit of 60 months for anyone receiving TANF benefits. It is important to note that North Carolina General Statute 108A-27 grants local county governments discretion in TANF program development. While most counties adhere to the general eligibility guidelines outlined in the Work First manual, some electing counties have additional flexibility in determining eligibility criteria.</p>
